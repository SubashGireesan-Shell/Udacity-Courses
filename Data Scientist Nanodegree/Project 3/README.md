# Recommendations with IBM

In this project, we will analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations about new articles that we think they will like. 

## Motivation

This project is a part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree program by Udacity. 

The data that we will be using in this project is taken from the [IBM Watson Studio Platform] [https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/].

The project follows these sequential steps: 

1) Exploratory Data Analysis
2) Rank Based Recommendations
3) User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
4) Content Base Recommendations (Extra and not included here)
5) Matrix Factorization
