# Unlocking Tomorrow's Power: The Art of Energy Demand Forecasting 
Data Science Nanodegree Capstone Project Report

## Motivation

This capstone project is a part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree program by Udacity. The aim of this project is to test the feasibility of using XGBoost for energy demand forecasting. The results have been compared with a simple baseline model. 

The dataset used for this project can be found here: [Hourly Energy Consumption Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption)
